 The goal of this project was to detect a specific face(could be scaled) in an array of background pixels and other faces and return a bounding box around the face. This project was first implemented in C code and then MIPS assembly. MisaSim was used to simulate the assembly code. More specific project instructions in instructions PDF file.
