 The goal of this project was to detect a specific face(could be scaled) in an array of background pixels and other faces and return a bounding box around the face. This project was first implemented in C code and then MIPS assembly. MisaSim was used to simulate the assembly code. More specific project instructions in instructions PDF file.
P1-1 is my initial algorithm implemented in C.
P1-2 is my improved algorithm implements in assembly.
